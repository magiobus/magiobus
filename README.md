 **Hi there, MagioBus Here ✌️** 
 *I'm a magician with coding powers. Not Kidding!*

I'm currently working on <a href="https://ninogamer.com">ninogamer.com</a> , an on demand merch platform to help creators sell their merch without hassles in latin america.

Currently doing React + Nextjs + MongoDB. I love the stack. 

I started coding using ruby on rails back in 2014 and attending hackathons all over Mexico and US. Doing projects from scratch is something that I really enjoy,  it requires not only tech knowledge, but to change hats often to solve other kinds of problems. 

**Random stuff....** 
I do magic tricks since high school, I told you I was not kidding :( 
I also make Music as Magiobus, Exnovias and Ex Primos, been collaborating with other artists too.
